CPF stands for Central Provident Fund. It is a comprehensive social security system in Singapore that aims to help Singaporeans save for retirement, healthcare, and housing needs. CPF contributions are mandatory for employees and employers in Singapore, and the funds accumulated in the CPF account can be used for various purposes throughout a person's life.
Here are the key features and uses of CPF: Retirement: A portion of an employee's monthly salary, contributed by both the employee and employer, is allocated to the CPF Retirement Account. The funds in this account can be used to provide a monthly income during retirement. Healthcare: CPF funds can be used to pay for healthcare expenses, including hospitalisation, medical treatments, and long-term care. The CPF MediSave account is specifically designated for healthcare purposes. Housing: CPF funds can be used to finance the purchase of a home in Singapore. The CPF Ordinary Account can be used for the down payment, monthly mortgage payments, and other housing-related expenses. Education: CPF funds can be used to pay for education and training expenses for the account holder, their spouse, or children. Insurance: CPF funds can be used to purchase various types of insurance, such as life insurance, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance.
CPF contributions are made by both the employee and the employer. The contribution rates vary based on the employee's age and income level, and there are contribution caps in place. CPF funds earn interest, and the interest rates are reviewed periodically.
HDB stands for the Housing & Development Board. It is a statutory board in Singapore that is responsible for public housing development and management. HDB plays a crucial role in providing affordable and quality housing for the citizens of Singapore.
Here are some key points about HDB: Public Housing: HDB is primarily responsible for the planning, construction, and management of public housing in Singapore. These housing developments are commonly known as HDB flats or HDB estates. HDB flats are designed to meet the housing needs of Singaporeans at various income levels. HDB Towns and Estates: HDB has developed numerous towns and estates across Singapore, each with its own set of facilities, amenities, and community services. These towns are designed to be self-sufficient, providing residents with access to housing, schools, shopping centers, parks, recreational facilities, and transportation networks. Flat Types: HDB offers a range of flat types to cater to different household sizes and needs. These include studio apartments, 2-room flats, 3-room flats, 4-room flats, 5-room flats, and executive flats. There are also specialized flat types such as the Design, Build and Sell Scheme (DBSS) flats and the Executive Condominiums (ECs), which are a hybrid of public and private housing. HDB Grants: HDB provides various housing grants to eligible Singaporean citizens to assist them in purchasing their first HDB flat, upgrading to a larger flat, or living near their parents. These grants help to make public housing more affordable and accessible. HDB Resale Market: HDB flats can be bought and sold in the resale market. This allows residents to sell their existing flats and purchase another HDB flat in a different location or of a different flat type. Upgrading Programs: HDB implements upgrading programs to enhance the living environment and amenities of older HDB estates. These programs aim to improve the quality of life for residents and include initiatives such as the Home Improvement Program (HIP) and the Neighbourhood Renewal Program (NRP). Leasehold Properties: HDB flats are typically sold on a 99-year leasehold basis, after which ownership reverts back to HDB. This leasehold structure ensures the affordability and long-term sustainability of public housing in Singapore.
